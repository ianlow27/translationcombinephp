## 0.0.3_251227-1737 - enhancements to translationcombine.php - A number of enhancements and bugfixes including: hide anything enclosed in square-brackets and fix margins, and spacings between starts of chapters. Note that in order to indicate a chapter start the chapter start THAT IS IN ENGLISH in the input file needs to be prefixed at the start of the line with a backtick (`). One to three backticks can be inserted indicating the size of the heading which can be from 120% to 180% of normal font size. The heading is then rendered as center-aligned. This formatting is automatically applied to the other language text.
